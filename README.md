# **JAVA Swing Lab Tasks**

This repository contains various lab tasks for the **Software Construction and Development (SCD)** course.  
The tasks are implemented using **Java Swing** for building graphical user interfaces,  
alongside **Java Collection Framework** for managing data and **exception handling** for error management.

## Introduction

The lab tasks focus on practical implementations of core Java concepts taught in the SCD course. They demonstrate how to use GUI components in **Java Swing**, handle data using the **Java Collection Framework**, and manage errors through **exception handling**. Each task addresses a specific topic, covering real-world scenarios to apply learned skills.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK** 8 or higher.
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or another IDE with GUI support.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
